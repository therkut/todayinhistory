**Wiki Scraper**
=========
This is Twitter Bot written in python - using ```requests```, ```beautifulsoup```, ```OAuth1Session modules```. It loads the [Wikipedia page]
(https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikipedi:Tarihte_bug%C3%BCn) and then after scraping the *tweetable* content it tweets
it to the Twitter account you specified in the script. Actually this script tweets events that occured today in the
past. Setting it up is really easy, just enter your API Keys and Token Info in the ```main.py``` file and you are good to go.
**It will be apprecaited if someone packages this**
